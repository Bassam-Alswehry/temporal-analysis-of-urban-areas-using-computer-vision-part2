# Temporal Analysis of Urban Areas — Part 2
## VEX (Visual Explanation Layer)

This part focuses on converting raw computer vision outputs into clear, human-readable visual explanations.

## Goal
Explain **where** and **how** urban structural change occurred using visual overlays and HUD-style annotations.

## Key Outputs
- Visual overlay heatmaps highlighting change regions
- HUD-style annotations for fast interpretation
- Interactive geospatial map showing change intensity across:
  - Coastal
  - Dense
  - Stable areas

## Role in the Project
This part acts as the **explainability layer**, bridging technical change detection (Part 1) with decision-making and analytics (Part 3).

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Folium
